While subscriptions to this tool can be costly, it has proven to be an invaluable resource for those seeking to improve their English writing skills. With the ability to write and translate English clearly and concisely, users can confidently create product descriptions that are both informative and engaging. Whether you are a business owner or a content creator, the Ahrefs Writing Tools Product Description Generator is a must-have tool for anyone looking to enhance their English writing abilities.

* Above I used that one for a site development project for Order Foods & Delivery.

* Unfortunately, It is not perfect to write because it did not meet of my demonstration for Readme. I had to write in my second English language and copy and paste in the AI generator then make editing instead. 

* I hope you read and understand the ReadMe.

## Testing
* Our comprehensive testing service ensures browser compatibility across a range of popular browsers including Safari, Google Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox. 

* I conduct thorough tests on desktop 24”, MacBook Pro laptop 21”, and iPhone 6” to ensure responsive design on screens of varying aspect ratios. While I have identified some issues with Safari's navbar responsiveness.

* I have decided not to pursue further fixes due to time constraints. However, I plan to conduct more thorough testing on Safari in the future, as I have found its developer tools to be superior to those of Chrome, which we typically use.

* #### See compare screen on Safari and Google Chrome responsive Screenshot attached
