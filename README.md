## Testing
* Our comprehensive testing service ensures browser compatibility across a range of popular browsers including Safari, Google Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox. 

* I conduct thorough tests on desktop 24”, MacBook Pro laptop 21”, and iPhone 6” to ensure responsive design on screens of varying aspect ratios. While I have identified some issues with Safari's navbar responsiveness.

* I have decided not to pursue further fixes due to time constraints. However, I plan to conduct more thorough testing on Safari in the future, as I have found its developer tools to be superior to those of Chrome, which we typically use.

* #### See compare screen on Safari and Google Chrome responsive Screenshot attached

## The lighthouse runs testing and results.

* Introducing our innovative product that enhances website performance with ease. The solution includes the addition of Alt tags, the removal of unnecessary HTML tags, and the incorporation of Meta keywords for SEO optimization. 

* It has been proven to improve website results, even in cases where responsive images have caused performance issues. I have decided not to pursue further fixes due to time constraints.
